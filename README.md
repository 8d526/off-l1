## API used

- [Connext](https://connext.network/) = State channel based cross chain bridge technoloy.
- [TheGraph](https://thegraph.com/) to call each chain's token prices
- [Web3 Modal]() = to allow you to connect via Metamask, Walletconnect, and Portis. WARNING: Do you access via smartcontract based wallet like Argent and Gnosis safe, as their wallet address is not compatible across different chains.
- [Portis](https://portis.io/) = Portis supports both xDAI and Matic (not BSC yet). To connect to the specific chain, go to the swap page (/exchange/*), then disconnet/connect
